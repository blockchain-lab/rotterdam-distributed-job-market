Installing Composer on Linux (proper):

1. Install NVM (node version manager)
	run: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
	This will git clone & install NVM in ~/.nvm dir, re-open terminal after install and verify installation with `command -v nvm`, should output `nvm`
	(https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installation)
2. Upgrade/Install NPM with NVM 
	run: nvm install node

3. Install all the composer npm stuff (note: some packages will start compiling C-code! Don't be scared by strange looking output, it's not running Fabric)
	npm install -g composer-cli
	npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer
	npm install -g composer-rest-server
4. Install Yeoman, code generation tool
	npm install -g yo

(Optional): Composer Playground, this is basically a site that allows you to create Business Network Defitions from your browser and execute some simple low-level commands such as asset creation. Basically like a SQL Workbench. Don't need this, we already created initial BND stuff and extracted it in a nice directory to work on the files directly. Deployment to Fabric can be done with the composer cli tools. Just tell it to bundle the files and deploy the package (instructions will follow)

	npm install -g composer-playground


Fabric-tools install:
	mkdir ~/fabric-tools && cd ~/fabric-tools
	curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.zip
	unzip fabric-dev-servers.zip

Fabric dev environment initial setup:
	cd ~/fabric-tools
	./downloadFabric.sh
	./startFabric.sh
	./createPeerAdminCard.sh

Now you have a dev environment for the two test networks, Rotterdam Logistics manual will follow

1. Install the composer runtime for our rotterdam_logistics_blocklab business network
	composer runtime install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --businessNetworkName rotterdam_logistics_blocklab

2. Deploy the network from the business network archive
	composer network start --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --archiveFile rotterdam_logistics_blocklab@0.0.1.bna --file networkadmin.card

	This will also create a networkadmin.card file in your current directory. Please do not commit this file.

3. Import the newly created Network Administrator card
	composer card import --file networkadmin.card
